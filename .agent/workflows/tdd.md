# TDD Session

1. **Scaffold Interfaces**
   - Define types/interfaces first.

2. **RED: Write Failing Test**
   - Write a test that fails because the implementation is missing.
   - Run the test to confirm failure.

3. **GREEN: Implement Minimal Code**
   - Write just enough code to pass the test.
   - Run the test to confirm success.

4. **REFACTOR: Improve Code**
   - Clean up code while keeping tests green.

5. **Verify Coverage**
   - Check if coverage is > 80%.
