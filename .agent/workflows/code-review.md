   - Is code self-documenting?

2. **Simplicity**
   - Is the logic overly complex?
   - Can it be simplified?

3. **Best Practices**
   - Is Immutability used?
   - Are errors handled?
   - Is type safety enforced?

4. **Performance**
   - Any obvious bottlenecks?
   - Unnecessary re-renders or queries?

**Action**: Provide a summary report of findings and suggestions.
