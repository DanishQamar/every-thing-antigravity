# Architect Review Workflow

1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Review existing architecture
   - Identify patterns and conventions
   - Document technical debt

2. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Integration points

3. **Design Proposal**
   - High-level architecture diagram
   - Component responsibilities
   - Data models
   - API contracts

4. **Trade-Off Analysis**
   - Pros/Cons/Alternatives
   - Decision rationale
